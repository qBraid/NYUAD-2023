# NYUAD Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World: Focusing on Quantum Computing (QC)

https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/events/2022/march/nyuad-hackathon-event.html

March 30 - April 1, 2022

## Technical challenge

_Create a program that applies one or more quantum algorithms to a social good
problem of your choice._

**Quantum algorithm examples**:

- Shor's algorithm
- Grover's search
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

**Social good topic examples**:

- Healthcare
- Science (e.g. AI, cryptography, biochemistry)
- Environment (climate)
- Education & Literacy
- Food Securities
- Crisis & Public Safety
- Financial Modeling
- Gaming

**Implementation requirements**:

- Must utilize quantum hardware available through preferably IBM. However, we
  set also have AWS devices available as well.
- You are also free to use any technology which allows you to solve the
  challenge.

**Bonus requirements**:

- Incorporate noisy simulation through IBM
- Incorporate a hybrid quantum-classical task through IBM

# qBraid Tutorials

Here, we provide useful tutorials on how to use qBraid-Lab, along with tutorials
on quantum computing, using IBM or Amazon Braket. The ladder were provided by
the [qiskit-tutorials](https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit-tutorials) and the
[amazon-braket-examples](https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-examples) github
repositories repsectively.

The repository is structured as follows:

- [Setting up Qiskit environment](qbraid_qiskit_setup/accessing_ibm_hardware.ipynb)
