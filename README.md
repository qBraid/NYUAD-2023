# NYUAD Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World: Focusing on Quantum Computing (QC) and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/events/2022/march/nyuad-hackathon-event.html

## Technical challenge

_Create a program that applies one or more quantum algorithms to a social good
problem of your choice._

**Quantum algorithm examples**:

- Shor's algorithm
- Grover's search
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

### Qubo Fault Detection
The program is used for fault detection and diagnosis of graph based networks. The implementation is based on qubo explained in [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7601.pdf).

**Requirements:**
- Install pyqubo using: pip install pyqubo

**Input to the program:**
- Sensor readings
- Paths from source to sensor
