## Technical challenge

_Create a program that applies one or more quantum algorithms to a social good
problem of your choice._

**Quantum algorithm examples**:

- Shor's algorithm
- Grover's search
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

---

SOLUTIONS:
1- Replacing Classical Pressure Sensors with Optimized Quantum Sensors
   - Quantum sensors are not invasive.
   - Quantom sensors are more erorr tolerant and to the changes in the environment around it.
   - Quantom sensors are more reliable.
   - Quantom sensors are more accurate which improve the ability to detect leakage.
